# The MultiMC target

The MultiMC target builds instances for the [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) launcher.

???+ warning "Publishing MultiMC instances"
     In contrast to other targets, the MultiMC instances will contain all mods directly instead of them being downloaded upon installing the pack.
     This makes MultiMC instances very large.
     So while they might be useful for some advanced users, consider publishing a [Modrinth pack](./modrinth.md) instead, as MultiMC can install these as well.
